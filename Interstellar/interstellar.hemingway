When Voyager 1 is unable to communicate with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Earth, the messages get saved in a tape recorder. Voyager 1 can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time. Signals take over 19 hours to reach Earth. The craft flies powered by plutonium. The power output of for the craft will continue to support some of its operations until 2025. Voyager 1 has a camera controlled by an onboard computer-managed image processing system. Instead of a camera operating independently such as those of the 1990s and later, the camera works a lot like an MRI. Filters interpret light patterns and colorize based off where light falls on the spectrum. There are more parts to Voyager 1 such as a specialized telescope to gather atmospheric data on Jupiter and Saturn. All of the parts operate on 69.63 kilobytes (kb) of memory. To put that amount of memory into perspective, 69.63 kb is less than a floppy disc or music tape from the 1980s. Voyager 1 accomplishes its tasks using less memory than the amount of space of a picture takes up from the mobile device you could be reading this with. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 entered a place we have never journeyed to, interstellar space. It is beyond the control of our sun. The interstellar matter will be studied until the mission’s end in 2025 when it is out of power.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"10j3","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"6lg2p","text":"NASA explores new technology, but older technology is often present because it works and is stable.

One individual person can be an excellent software engineer, but professional presence weighs heavily too. We as a species have a brain that works with spoken and written instructions in addition to non-verbal cues. We need input so we can solve problems.

Five minutes of a stand-up accomplish more than asking for advice randomly when you get stuck.

When we practice compassion in our professional interactions, especially when it comes to performance responses, we work better together.
