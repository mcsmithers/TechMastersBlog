My experience level is that of a junior-level programmer. Typically, it is competitive for those at my phase in their career. It was prudent to search for employment in the area on time for my moving there. I began by getting a Google Voice number that forwarded to my cell phone to localize myself before relocation. I scoured through many resources such as Indeed.com and LinkedIn. There was a posting for a Python developer, a programming language I use and enjoy, and submitted my resume.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"41ogb","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"aaue9","text":"Some time went by after the application, and the prospects were not looking optimal. One day, I received the phone call from Houston that sent me on this path. I spoke to several team members and managers. I learned more details of what I was going to work with potentially. Python packages were studied. I brainstormed potential Python projects I can do that would have a NASA theme, such as a program recording comet observations. After a phone interview, I was nervous about the outcome, but felt positive about it. Later on, I got the results. I was being considered for an internship if I was interested. There was no doubt in mind of my interest. It was an opportunity to work in a place that was a dream for me.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"702u1","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"2v81s","text":"Another conversation followed with the team that I would be working with.
